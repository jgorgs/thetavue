# ThetaVue Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices behind ThetaVue, our modern portfolio management app for options traders. ThetaVue is designed to be reliable, fast, and user-friendly—all while providing advanced analytics and trade planning tools.

## Frontend Technologies

We use a blend of modern tools and frameworks to create a sleek and responsive user interface:

- **Next.js with TypeScript**: Provides a robust environment for building dynamic, server-rendered pages that update quickly.
- **UI Components & Styling**:
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Simplifies styling with utility classes and is enhanced with a glassmorphism design approach to give panels a frosted, modern look.
  - **Tremor**: Offers pre-built, high-quality UI components that help maintain consistent design and usability.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Recharts & D3.js**: These libraries power our interactive charts and graphs, making complex trading data easy to understand at a glance.
  - **Cal-Heatmap**: Used for the GitHub-style trade activity heatmap, providing clear visual insights on trading frequency and performance.
- **Authentication via Clerk**: Integrates secure and user-friendly authentication, ensuring that signing in and signing up is both fast and reliable.

These choices allow us to deliver a fast, visually appealing, and interactive experience that caters to the needs of options traders.

## Backend Technologies

Our backend is built to ensure speedy data processing, secure storage, and reliable integration with external services:

- **Database & Data Management**:
  - **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: Acts as our primary data store. It manages user profiles, portfolio details, and historical trading data while enforcing data confidentiality with row-level security policies.
- **Server & API Integration**:
  - **Tastytrade API**: Directly connects to users’ Tastytrade accounts for real-time data synchronization, ensuring that trading positions and metrics are accurate and up to date.
  - **Clerk Integration**: Works with Supabase to grant secure JWT-based authentication, tying each action to the right user and enabling targeted data access.
  - **Background Sync Jobs**: Built to pull data from Tastytrade, these jobs run every 15 minutes and include robust error handling (automatic retries, caching, and manual refresh options) to maintain system reliability.

Together, these backend components securely manage data and support the complex functionalities that traders rely on for real-time portfolio management.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Our infrastructure choices are focused on performance, scalability, and ease of deployment:

- **Hosting Platform**:
  - **Vercel**: Chosen for its seamless deployment capabilities with Next.js applications, it ensures fast global delivery and reliable uptime.
- **CI/CD Pipelines & Version Control**:
  - Integrated workflows allow for smooth and ongoing updates, ensuring that new features and fixes reach users rapidly.
  
These decisions enable ThetaVue to scale effectively as user demand grows while keeping the deployment process streamlined and transparent.

## Third-Party Integrations

Integrations with specialized services enhance ThetaVue’s functionality and user experience:

- **Tastytrade API**: Enables direct account linking, real-time data sync, and automatic refresh strategies to ensure users have up-to-date portfolio data.
- **Clerk**: Provides secure and modern authentication, handling sign-up, sign-in processes, and session management.
- **Selected Development Tools**:
  - **V0 by Vercel, Cursor, Lovable, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT 4o**: These tools assist in rapid, AI-powered development and the generation of modern, robust frontend components. They ensure that our code is efficient, up-to-date, and adheres to best practices.

These integrations not only simplify complex tasks but also enhance the overall experience by ensuring reliability and cutting-edge functionality.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Maintaining user data security and ensuring a smooth performance are top priorities:

- **Security Measures**:
  - **Authentication**: Leveraging Clerk’s secure auth methods with multi-factor support and robust JWT handling.
  - **Data Protection**: Supabase’s row-level security, combined with encryption for both at-rest and in-transit data, protects sensitive information.
  - **API Security**: Incorporates rate limiting and detailed error handling to manage issues when external APIs (like Tastytrade) are down.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - **Real-Time Data Sync**: Background jobs ensure that trading information is refreshed frequently, keeping the dashboard updates under 2 seconds.
  - **Caching & Manual Refresh**: Maintains service continuity during API disruptions by caching key data and offering manual intervention if necessary.
  
Together, these strategies guarantee a secure environment and a responsive user experience for every trader.
