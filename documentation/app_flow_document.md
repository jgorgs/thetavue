# ThetaVue: App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user lands on ThetaVue, they are greeted with a modern, dark-themed landing page that instantly communicates the platform’s purpose with the tagline "Plan Smart. Profit Consistently." The landing page is designed with glassmorphism elements that create an inviting atmosphere with a dark background and frosted glass panels. A user can choose to sign up or sign in by clicking on clearly visible options. New users are guided through an intuitive sign-up process managed by Clerk, where they are prompted to enter basic profile details. The system supports traditional email sign-up as well as other OAuth methods integrated through Clerk, ensuring a streamlined registration process. After creating an account, the user is immediately encouraged to link their Tastytrade account through a secure OAuth connection, a critical step that enables real-time synchronization of portfolio data. In the event that a user forgets their password, a dedicated recovery process allows them to easily reset their credentials, with clear instructions and verification steps in place to ensure account security. The sign-in process similarly relies on Clerk, and once logged in, users can sign out from any page by accessing a simple, intuitive logout option available in the header of the application interface.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Immediately after successful authentication, the user is taken to the comprehensive portfolio dashboard, which serves as the central hub for all application functionalities. The dashboard is designed to present an overview of both real-time and historical data, displaying key measures like Delta, Theta, and Vega alongside performance metrics and visual comparisons with benchmarks like the S&P 500. The interface is structured around a visually appealing dark mode layout furnished with glassmorphism cards that softly glow to highlight important figures. Prominent navigation menus, headers, and sidebars are thoughtfully placed to ensure that users can easily access various modules such as trade plan creation, detailed analytics, and account settings. The default view not only displays a summary of the user’s current positions but also offers a quick glance at their trade adherence score, recent notifications regarding synchronization status, and overall portfolio performance.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
From the dashboard, users can seamlessly navigate between various core modules of ThetaVue with intuitive transitions that maintain continuity throughout the user journey. The first core feature is the Tastytrade integration. As users connect their trading account via OAuth, the system securely fetches real-time positions, historical transaction data, and key Greek metrics such as Delta, Theta, and Vega. Data synchronization is handled in the background every 15 minutes, ensuring that even if connectivity issues occur, the app continues to display cached data along with clear status indicators. Transitioning further, users have access to the detailed portfolio view where each open and closed position is listed with comprehensive data on trade performance and strategic positioning. The next area is the trade plan module, which is built around a wizard-based setup that guides the user step by step through the process of setting portfolio goals, risk profiles, strategy allocations, and Greek targets. As users work through the trade plan process, the application calculates a visual adherence score that continuously monitors compliance with the established plan and provides real-time rebalancing suggestions if deviations occur. Additionally, users can explore an in-depth analytics module that features interactive graphs, customizable filters, and a GitHub-style heatmap calendar. This module offers advanced strategy analytics, enabling traders to review performance data by period, strategy type, risk-adjusted returns, and more. Navigation between these modules is smooth and fully integrated, with clear links and buttons ensuring that movement from one page to another feels natural and leaves no room for confusion.

## Settings and Account Management
ThetaVue provides a comprehensive settings area where users can manage their personal information, update preferences, and control their data management options. In this section, a user is able to configure notifications, even though the MVP currently focuses on in-app alerts, ensuring that any future enhancements like email or SMS notifications are easily accessible. Users can update security settings and review their authentication status, as well as set preferences for data retention and historical data export in compliance with tax and regulatory requirements. The settings section also includes a view of synchronization logs and error notifications, which is particularly useful in monitoring the health of Tastytrade API integrations. Once adjustments are made or information reviewed, the application provides simple options to return to the main dashboard, ensuring the continuity of the user's workflow without any disruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Throughout the application, ThetaVue is engineered to handle error states and alternate paths robustly. In cases where a user attempts to perform an action with invalid data or if connectivity issues occur during data synchronization, the app displays clear, unambiguous error messages that explain the issue in simple terms. For instance, if the Tastytrade API is inaccessible or returns an error, the dashboard displays a prominent notification along with an indicator showing the last successful data refresh. The system employs retry logic with exponential backoff and allows users to manually trigger a data refresh if necessary. Should a user enter incorrect login credentials or attempt to access a restricted module, friendly error messages guide them toward resolving the issue without causing disorientation. All error messages and fallback screens are designed to maintain the polished look and feel of the dark mode interface, ensuring that even during disruptions, the user experience remains consistent and professional.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The ThetaVue application takes users on a well-orchestrated journey from the moment they first encounter the landing page through to daily portfolio management and strategic analysis. Beginning with a streamlined onboarding process and robust authentication via Clerk, users quickly access a dynamic dashboard that offers an intuitive blend of real-time data and historical insights. Transitioning effortlessly between modules, users can manage positions, create detailed trade plans, and explore sophisticated analytics using interactive visualizations that convert complex data into actionable insights. Settings and account management modules further empower users to customize their experience, ensuring the app meets personal and regulatory requirements while always providing clear indicators during error states or API downtimes. In the end, ThetaVue’s design emphasizes a consistent, responsive, and premium user experience that supports the core goal of helping options traders plan smart and profit consistently.
